	abstract = {Recently, targeting tumor microenvironment has become a novel approach for cancer therapy. Collagen is one of important components of tissue microenvironment, and has been considered as a new visible target for cancer therapy. In this work, multiphoton microscopy ({MPM}) was used to monitor the changes of collagen in tumor microenvironment during tumor progression. It was found that {MPM} facilitates imaging of tumor cells and collagen. {MPM} images in different tumor microenvironment during tumor progression shows obvious increase in cell number and collagen degration. In addition, the quantitative analysis of collagen content and orientation index in tumor microenvironment shows significant alteration during tumor progression. These results suggest that {MPM} has the ability to monitor the changes of collagen morphology in tumor microenvironment and quantify content and orientation index of collagen during tumor progression. Therefore this technique is a powerful imaging tool for the investigation of targeting tumor microenvironment for cancer therapy. © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

	doi = {10.1093/bioinformatics/btp184},
	abstract = {Motivation: Modern anatomical and developmental studies often require high-resolution imaging of large specimens in three dimensions (3D). Confocal microscopy produces high-resolution 3D images, but is limited by a relatively small field of view compared with the size of large biological specimens. Therefore, motorized stages that move the sample are used to create a tiled scan of the whole specimen. The physical coordinates provided by the microscope stage are not precise enough to allow direct reconstruction (Stitching) of the whole image from individual image stacks.
Results: To optimally stitch a large collection of 3D confocal images, we developed a method that, based on the Fourier Shift Theorem, computes all possible translations between pairs of 3D images, yielding the best overlap in terms of the cross-correlation measure and subsequently finds the globally optimal configuration of the whole group of 3D images. This method avoids the propagation of errors by consecutive registration steps. Additionally, to compensate the brightness differences between tiles, we apply a smooth, non-linear intensity transition between the overlapping images. Our stitching approach is fast, works on 2D and 3D images, and for small image sets does not require prior knowledge about the tile configuration.
Availability: The implementation of this method is available as an {ImageJ} plugin distributed as a part of the Fiji project (Fiji is just {ImageJ}: http://pacific.mpi-cbg.de/).

The purposes of this study were to investigate differences in collagen fibre patterns between tumour-induced stromal tissue and normal stroma, and between high-grade and low-grade breast cancer stroma, using second harmonic generation microscopy. Thirty-seven ductal carcinomas were examined: Twenty-one Luminal A phenotype and sixteen {HER}2 or Basal-like phenotype. Three regions were examined in each case: intratumoral, juxtatumoral and extratumoral. Two images were captured in each region. Two characteristics of collagen fibres were examined: the degree of straightness, and the degree of alignment. Collagen fibres were visually classified as curly, intermediate or straight, and as parallel or not parallel. The results of angle measurement and visual analysis showed that collagen fibres were straightest in the intratumoral region and curliest in the extratumoral region. Collagen fibres were more parallel in the juxtatumoral region compared to the two other regions. There were no significant differences between high-grade and low-grade tumours. As a breast tumour progresses, collagen fibres appear to straighten and align at the tumour boundary. This could facilitate invasion of the tumour into the surrounding stroma.},

New techniques, such as serial analysis of gene expression and {cDNA} microarrays, have enabled measurement of the expression of thousands of genes in a single experiment, revealing many new, potentially important cancer genes1,2. These genome screening tools can comprehensively survey one tumor at a time; however, analysis of hundreds of specimens from patients in different stages of disease is needed to establish the diagnostic, prognostic and therapeutic importance of each of the emerging cancer gene candidates. Here we have developed an array-based high-throughput technique that facilitates gene expression and copy number surveys of very large numbers of tumors. As many as 1000 cylindrical tissue biopsies from individual tumors can be distributed in a single tumor tissue microarray. Sections of the microarray provide targets for parallel in situ detection of {DNA}, {RNA} and protein targets in each specimen on the array, and consecutive sections allow the rapid analysis of hundreds of molecular markers in the same set of specimens. Our detection of six gene amplifications as well as p53 and estrogen receptor expression in breast cancer demonstrates the power of this technique for defining new subgroups of tumors.},
