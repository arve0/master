# latex setup
To build .tex, .pdf or .html files one needs pandoc and the filters:

- [pandoc-crossref](https://github.com/lierdakil/pandoc-crossref)
- [pandoc-citeproc](https://github.com/jgm/pandoc-citeproc)

They are installed with `cabal install pandoc-crossref pandoc-citeproc`.

For more details on building files, see the [Makefile](Makefile).
